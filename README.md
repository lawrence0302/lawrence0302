A Bank Loan Performance Analysis in Power BI involves visualizing and monitoring key metrics related to a bank's loan portfolio. This includes tracking loan disbursements, repayments, delinquency rates, default rates, and customer credit profiles. Power BI dashboards can provide interactive reports that help identify trends, assess credit risk, and improve decision-making. The goal is to enhance portfolio health, optimize recovery efforts, and ensure compliance with lending policies.

ii: https://github.com/lawrence0302/lawrence0302/blob/main/Customer%20Churn%20Analysis.sql

Customer churn analysis using SQL involves querying a customer database to identify patterns and indicators of customers who have stopped using a product or service. 

This includes:
Identifying inactive or cancelled accounts over a time period.
Comparing active vs. churned customer behavior (e.g., last purchase date, login frequency).
Calculating churn rate:  Churn Rate = (Churned Customers / Total Customers at Start) * 100
Segmenting customers by demographics or usage to detect high-risk groups.
Creating cohorts to track churn over time.

iii: https://github.com/lawrence0302/lawrence0302/blob/main/Marketing_Campaign_Performance_Insights.ipynb

Marketing Campaign Performance Insights using Python involves using Python to evaluate how well marketing campaigns are performing. By leveraging libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, you can:

Clean and prepare campaign data.
Calculate key metrics such as conversion rate, CTR, and ROI.
Segment performance by channels, regions, or customer demographics.
Visualize trends and compare campaign effectiveness.
The goal is to uncover actionable insights that help optimize marketing strategies and improve return on investment.
