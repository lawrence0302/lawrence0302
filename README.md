Here are My projects,

i: https://github.com/lawrence0302/lawrence0302/blob/main/Bank%20Loan%20Performance%20Analysis%20Power%20BI.pdf

A Bank Loan Performance Analysis in Power BI involves visualizing and monitoring key metrics related to a bank's loan portfolio. This includes tracking loan disbursements, repayments, delinquency rates, default rates, and customer credit profiles. Power BI dashboards can provide interactive reports that help identify trends, assess credit risk, and improve decision-making. The goal is to enhance portfolio health, optimize recovery efforts, and ensure compliance with lending policies.

ii: https://github.com/lawrence0302/lawrence0302/blob/main/Customer%20Churn%20Analysis.sql

Customer churn analysis using SQL involves querying a customer database to identify patterns and indicators of customers who have stopped using a product or service. 

This includes:
Identifying inactive or cancelled accounts over a time period.
Comparing active vs. churned customer behavior (e.g., last purchase date, login frequency).
Calculating churn rate:  Churn Rate = (Churned Customers / Total Customers at Start) * 100
Segmenting customers by demographics or usage to detect high-risk groups.
Creating cohorts to track churn over time.

iii: https://github.com/lawrence0302/lawrence0302/blob/main/Marketing_Campaign_Performance_Insights.ipynb

Marketing Campaign Performance Insights using Python involves using Python to evaluate how well marketing campaigns are performing. By leveraging libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, you can:

Clean and prepare campaign data.
Calculate key metrics such as conversion rate, CTR, and ROI.
Segment performance by channels, regions, or customer demographics.
Visualize trends and compare campaign effectiveness.
The goal is to uncover actionable insights that help optimize marketing strategies and improve return on investment.

iv: https://github.com/lawrence0302/lawrence0302/blob/main/Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb

To build a machine learning model that detects fraudulent credit card transactions accurately and efficiently, especially focusing on minimizing false negatives.

This project demonstrates how machine learning can effectively detect fraudulent credit card transactions, even in highly imbalanced datasets. By focusing on minimizing false negatives and optimizing for recall, the model can act as a reliable decision-support tool for financial institutions.
Key takeaways:
Handling class imbalance is critical.
Feature scaling and algorithm selection greatly influence model success.
Real-time fraud detection is feasible with a well-trained ML model.

## 📊 Pathways & Performance: A Student Insight Report

This project is a comprehensive data analysis report aimed at uncovering insights into student academic performance and progression pathways. Using real or simulated student data, the notebook explores trends, patterns, and key factors influencing academic outcomes across various subjects, courses, and demographics.

### 🔍 Objectives

* Analyze student performance metrics (e.g., grades, attendance, course load)
* Identify key trends in academic success and progression
* Explore correlations between student pathways and outcomes
* Provide actionable insights to educators, administrators, and policy makers

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Python**
* **Pandas** for data manipulation
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis
* **NumPy** for numerical operations

### 📈 Key Insights

* Performance distribution across different student groups
* Impact of subject selection on academic outcomes
* Visual exploration of progression pathways over time
* Identification of at-risk students through performance clustering
